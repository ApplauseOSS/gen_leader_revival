Mission
=======

This is a project to revive and modernize the [gen_leader library](http://www.cs.chalmers.se/~hanssv/leader_election/doc/gen_leader.html).
Numerous versions of this project exist, developed by disparate groups with different aims. By collecting and integrating these we hope
to provide a new standard-library-quality module for the Erlang runtime that provides leader-election functionality without many of the
difficulties traditionally associated with such.
